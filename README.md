## Workflow

1. **User Interaction**
   - Users interact with the system through web/mobile applications, placing bets, viewing odds, and tracking bet statuses in real-time.

2. **API Gateway**
   - The API Gateway handles incoming requests, validates them, and routes them to the appropriate backend services.

3. **Backend Processing**
   - The Bet Management Service processes bet placements, updates odds, and communicates with the Settlement Service for payout processing.
   - The User Management Service handles user authentication, profile management, and authorization.

4. **L2 Smart Contracts**
   - Bet transactions are processed on the L2 blockchain using smart contracts, ensuring quick and cost-effective execution.
   - The smart contracts manage stakes, record bets, and execute settlements based on outcomes provided by the Oracle Service.

5. **Off-Chain Oracle Service**
   - The Oracle Service fetches real-time event data and outcomes, pushing this information to the smart contracts on L2 for accurate bet settlement.

6. **Settlement and Finality**
   - Settled bets and batched transactions are periodically committed to the L1 blockchain, ensuring security and finality.

7. **Data Storage and Analytics**
   - All transaction data, bet history, and user information are stored in the relational and NoSQL databases for persistence and quick access.
   - Data Analytics services process this information for insights and reporting.

8. **Real-Time Updates**
   - The WebSocket connection provides users with real-time updates on betting odds, status, and settlements, ensuring a seamless user experience.
